            <p class="section-text">
                This site report describes my learning experience while completing the CSY1063 Web Development module. The aim of this project is to design and develop a responsive portfolio website using HTML and CSS. And manage the project using Git and GitHub with regular and meaningfull commits.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Before starting this module, I had limited experience creating complete websites. Through this assignment, I learned how to structure pages properly, apply styling, and ensure responsiveness.

            <h2 class="section-title">Challenges & Development Process</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                During the development of process, I have faced challenges with managing HTML structure and layout. Making the design responsive to mobile devices was the most difficult part of this project.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Through testing, debugging, and gradual improvements, I was able to resolve these issues and refine the design. Using GitHub helped me track changes and improve the website over time.

            <h2 class="section-title">Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                The website was built using HTML5 and CSS3 without any external frameworks. CSS Grid was used on the projects page, while Flexbox was used for navigation and content alignment.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Media queries were applied to ensure the website works correctly on both desktop and mobile devices, including a responsive hamburger menu.

            <h2 class="section-title">UI & Design Decisions</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                I chose a dark theme to give the website a modern and professional look. Blue accent colors were used to highlight links and interactive elements for better usability.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Design inspiration was taken from modern developer portfolios and image references found on Pinterest.

            <p class="section-text">
                In conclusion, this portfolio website was created in order to showcase my skill , my levels of understanding, as well as my knowledge regarding the development of a website using HTML & CSS. This portfolio page consists of several other pages like Home, About, Projects, Contact, Resume, Video Demonstration, and Site Report which are all connected together through a proper navigational system. This portfolio page is completely responsive in both mobile and desktop devices.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                By this project, I have learned the application of semantic HTML coding, proper use of CSS and layout and implementing proper responsive webpage using grid, flexbox and media queries. Furthermore, I also have used gitHub version control for managing the changes.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                In summary, this  project helped me build confidence in building responsive websites using HTML and CSS. This project successfully demonstrates my current understanding of web development principles and meets the requirements of the CSY1063 module.
